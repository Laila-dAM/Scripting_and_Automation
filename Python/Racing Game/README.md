This code implements a simple 2D racing game using the Pygame library. The player controls a character represented by a kaomoji who must avoid obstacles and collect speed boosters. The obstacles and items are randomly generated, and the difficulty increases over time. The score is displayed in the top left corner, and the game ends when you collide with an obstacle. Visually, the game is enriched with colorful kaomojis, providing a fun and creative touch.

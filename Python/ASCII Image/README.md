This Python project converts images into ASCII art by transforming each pixel in the image into a character that represents its shade of gray. The program allows the user to load an image in formats such as .jpg, .png, or .jpeg, and converts it into a simplified version using ASCII characters such as ":", "#", "@", and others. The image is resized to fit the width of the terminal, converted to grayscale, and then mapped to characters corresponding to different light intensities. The user can view the generated art directly in the terminal and also save the output to a text file. The project is a simple and creative way to learn image manipulation and programming in Python.
